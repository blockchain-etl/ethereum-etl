## Querying in BigQuery

If you'd rather not export the blockchain data yourself, we publish all tables as a public dataset in [BigQuery](https://medium.com/@medvedev1088/ethereum-blockchain-on-google-bigquery-283fb300f579).

Data is updated near real-time (~4-minute delay to account for block finality).
