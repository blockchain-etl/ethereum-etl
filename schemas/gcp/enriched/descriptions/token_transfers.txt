The most popular type of transaction on the Ethereum blockchain invokes a contract of type ERC20 to perform a
transfer operation, moving some number of tokens from one 20-byte address to another 20-byte address.
This table contains the subset of those transactions and has further processed and denormalized the data to make it
easier to consume for analysis of token transfer events.
